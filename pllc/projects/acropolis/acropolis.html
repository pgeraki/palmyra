                    "As a building whose inception and realization are laden with cultural significance as well as a polemical political agenda, the new Acropolis Museum in Athens, designed by Bernard Tschumi in the literal and figurative shadow of the Parthenon, is not an easy building to critique formally. It is especially difficult to ignore certain extraneous aspects that inadvertently influenced its design, such as the political ambition inscribed in the rhetoric surrounding the project, the desire of the Greek government to prove to the world, and to the British in particular, that Greece could finally be entrusted with the safeguarding of the Elgin marbles. However, while responding to these programmatic demands as well as to the surrounding urban context, the museum remains an architectural object with an internal logic of its own. It is neither a muted and deferential solution nor an overstated gesture seeking to assert its presence in the face of a greater one. It is, one could say, a building without an inferiority complex."
